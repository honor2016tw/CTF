There is a js file included by index called `cute.js`
`https://hackme.inndy.tw/cute.js`

Inside this js file are a lot of japanese style emojis.

Needless to say,they have been obfuscated with some methods.

This is associated with a obfuscator `aaencode`.

We can eval it in developer's tool of web browser.

Than we got a QRcode. That's all.
